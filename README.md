This [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) module provides a terrain canvas layer that lets the GM designate areas of the canvas to have one or more terrain types. Each terrain is associated with an [active effect](https://foundryvtt.com/article/active-effects/), which can be applied to tokens manually or as the token moves across the canvas.

# Thanks

Special thanks to:
- [dev7355608](https://github.com/dev7355608) for answering yet more random PIXIjs questions.
- [DFreds](https://github.com/DFreds) for inspiration from their [Convenient Effects](https://github.com/DFreds/dfreds-convenient-effects) module.

# Module compatibility

## Required modules
- [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper)
- [socketlib](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-socketlib)

## Recommended modules
- [Elevated Vision](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-elevated-vision). Elevated Vision allows the GM to set elevation for the canvas. Terrain Mapper will account for the differing elevation when applying terrains to the token.
